      <h1>Who the Heck We Are</h1>
      <img src="/images/bloofy-team-2025.webp" alt="Bloofy Team 2025" class="content-image">
      <p>Welcome to <strong>Bloofy</strong>—the internet’s official dumping ground for 2025’s funniest fails. From self-driving cars that can’t parallel park to smart fridges that judge your midnight snacks, we’re here to roast the future while it’s still updating its firmware. Our mission? To make you laugh so hard you accidentally choke on your oat milk latte. (Don’t worry, we’ll write about it.)</p>

    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Why Bloofy Exists (and Why It Can’t Be Stopped)</h2>
      <p>Let’s be honest: the world has enough “serious” websites. Bloofy was born after one too many pizza-fueled brainstorms and at least three near-death experiences with AI chatbots. We exist to answer life’s big questions, like: “Why is glow-in-the-dark sushi trending?” or “Did my vacuum cleaner just join a cult?”</p>

    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Our Vibe</h2>
      <p>Picture your sarcastic best friend on three espressos. That’s us. We see the world’s chaos—whether it’s underwater yoga, toaster musicals, or treadmills launching people into orbit—and turn it into comedy gold. Think of us as part Buzzfeed, part stand-up show, part meme page your boss would definitely fire you for browsing at work.</p>

    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Meet the Circus (a.k.a. Our Team)</h2>
      <p>We’re not “journalists”—we’re caffeine-powered chaos gremlins who write faster than your smart watch drains its battery. Our squad includes ex-baristas (latte art trauma), tech nerds (still grounded for crashing drones), and meme lords (occupational hazard: carpal tunnel from scrolling X too much). Follow our unfiltered nonsense at <strong>@BloofyNet</strong>, and if you’ve got a fail worthy of eternal internet glory, slide into our DMs. We promise to roast you with love.</p>

    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Join the Fun (Before the Robots Take Over)</h2>
      <p>Bloofy isn’t just a site—it’s a vibe, a lifestyle, a questionable use of your Wi-Fi. Scroll our categories (Tech, Fashion, Fitness, Food Fails, etc.) and laugh harder than a rogue kettlebell to the shin. Got your own 2025 disaster story? Post it with <strong>#Bloofy2025</strong>—we might immortalize your chaos forever (and yes, your mom will see it).</p>

      <h2>Knowledge You Didn’t Ask For</h2>
      <p>If you actually want to sound smart while laughing at chaos, you can dive into internet culture, meme history, or trend reports. Or you can just keep scrolling Bloofy, because honestly, who has time for research when your fridge is texting you “We need to talk”?</p>
